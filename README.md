# KubeCon US 2022 ~~Demo~~ Tutorial (WIP)

This demo was intended for KubeCon NA 2022, but the demo gods did not smile upon it. It will be completed to serve as a tutorial for those seeking to combine Sigstore's services and tools with SPIFFE identities.

If you follow this repo, I will make a release on GitHub when it is ready for your consumption.

## Requirements

This demo leverages the following programs and utilities:

* [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
